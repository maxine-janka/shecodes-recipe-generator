      Ingredients
      140g butter, softened, plus extra for the tin
      140g caster sugar
      2 large eggs, beaten
      140g self-raising flour
      1 tsp baking powder
      2 very ripe bananas, mashed
      50g icing sugar
      handful dried banana chips, for decoration
      <br  />
      <br  />
      Method
      <br />
      STEP 1
      Heat oven to 180C/160C fan/gas 4.

      STEP 2
      Butter a 2lb loaf tin and line the base and sides with baking parchment.

      STEP 3
      Cream 140g softened butter and 140g caster sugar until light and fluffy, then slowly add 2 beaten large eggs with a little of the 140g flour.

      STEP 4
      Fold in the remaining flour, 1 tsp baking powder and 2 mashed bananas.

      STEP 5
      Pour the mixture into the prepared tin and bake for about 50 mins, or until cooked through. Check the loaf at 5-min intervals from around 30-40 mins in the oven by testing it with a skewer (it should be able to be inserted and removed cleanly), as the time may vary depending on the shape of your loaf tin.

      STEP 6
      Cool in the tin for 10 mins, then remove to a wire rack.

      STEP 7
      Mix 50g icing sugar with 2-3 tsp water to make a runny icing.

      STEP 8
      Drizzle the icing across the top of the cake and decorate with a handful of banana chips.
